    <h1>💡 About This Site</h1>
    <p>
        This site was made to make techies smile — one fortune at a time.<br>
        These messages are crafted with love, humor, and just a hint of sarcasm from the dev world.<br><br>
        Created by a curious coder... maybe even while avoiding actual work 😉
